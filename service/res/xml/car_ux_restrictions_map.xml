<!--
This XML allows OEMs to configure a driving state to UX restrictions.  There are 2 major classes
of configuration:
1. Restriction Mapping as defined by the <restrictionMapping> tag.
2. Restriction Parameters for restrictions that can be parametrized as defined by
   <restrictionParameters> tag.

Note:
   1. The tags and attributes are declared in packages/services/Car/service/res/attrs.xml.
   2. The driving states defined there should align with driving states (@CarDrivingState) defined in
   packages/services/Car/car-lib/src/android/car/drivingstate/CarDrivingStateEvent.java
   3. Similarly the UX restrictions should align with
   packages/services/Car/car-lib/src/android/car/drivingstate/CarUxRestrictions.java

<UxRestrictions xmlns:car="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
    <!-- Map the driving states to UX restrictions here -->
    <RestrictionMapping>
        <DrivingState car:state="parked">
            <Restrictions car:uxr="baseline"/>
        </DrivingState>

        <DrivingState car:state="idling">
            <Restrictions car:uxr="fully_restricted"/>
        </DrivingState>

        <!-- This is to illustrate how to add multiple speed ranges.  The restrictions here
        are the same for both the speed ranges, but could be configured to be different.
        NOTE:
        1. The speed units is in meters per second to be in accordance with the
        PERF_VEHICLE SPEED definition in hardware/interfaces/automotive/vehicle/2.0/types.hal
        2. The speed ranges should be non overlapping, i.e one speed value cannot be in more
        than one range.  It is denoted in a left closed, right open interval [minSpeed, maxSpeed).
        For ex: [0,5) indicates speed >= 0 && speed < 5.0.
        3. For a speed range with no high limit, maxSpeed is not filled.  For ex., if the speed
        range is anything >=5, only the minSpeed is filled with a value of 5.  There cannot be
        a range higher than this, which will violate the 2nd condition above.
        4. If the above conditions are not met, mapping behavior is undefined. -->
